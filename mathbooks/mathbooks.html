We begin with function notation, a basic toolkit of functions, and the basic operation with functions: composition and transformation. Building from these basic functions, as each new family of functions is introduced we explore the important features of the function: its graph, domain and range, intercepts, and asymptotes. The exploration then moves to evaluating and solving equations involving the function, finding inverses, and culminates with modeling using the function.<br><em>Links</em>: <strong><a href=" http://www.opentextbookstore.com/precalc/" target="_blank">website</a></strong>, <strong><a href=" books/pifs.pdf" target="_blank">detailed solutions</a></strong>.</p>

The book consists almost entirely of problems. Some of the problems are designed to lead you to think about a concept, others are designed to help you figure out a concept and state a theorem about it, while still others ask you to prove the theorem. <br><em>Links</em>: <strong><a href=" https://math.dartmouth.edu/news-resources/electronic/kpbogart/" target="_blank">website</a></strong>.</p>

Judson</strong> <br><strong><a href=" books/aata.pdf" target="_blank">Abstract Algebra </a></strong><br><em>ID</em>: AATA. <em>Year</em>: 2004. <em>Require</em>: InAl.<br>(pag. vi) Traditionally, these courses have covered the theoretical aspects of groups, rings, and fields. However, with the development of computing in the last several decades, applications that involve abstract algebra and discrete mathematics have become increasingly important. <br><em>Links</em>: <strong><a href=" http://abstract.ups.edu/download.html" target="_blank">website</a></strong>.</p>

    <h3>Space</h3>

    <p><strong>Michael P. Hitchman</strong> <br><strong><a href=" books/gect.pdf" target="_blank">Geometry with an Introduction to Cosmic Topology </a></strong><br><em>ID</em>: GECT. <em>Year</em>: 2018. <em>Require</em>: MIRA.<br>(pag. iii) Mathematicians and cosmologists have expended considerable amounts of effort investigating the shape of the universe, and this field of research is called cosmic topology. Geometry plays a fundamental role in this research. Under basic assumptions about the nature of space, there is a simple relationship between the geometry of the universe and its shape, and there are just three possibilities for the type of geometry: hyperbolic geometry, elliptic geometry, and Euclidean geometry. These are the geometries we study in this text.<br><em>Links</em>: <strong><a href=" https://mphitchman.com/" target="_blank">website</a></strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>Balazs Csikos</strong> <br><strong><a href=" books/dige.pdf" target="_blank">Diferential Geometry </a></strong><br><em>ID</em>: DiGe. <em>Year</em>: 2014. <em>Require</em>: MIRA.<br>(summary) In the first chapter, some preliminary definitions and facts are collected, that will be used later. The classical roots of modern differential geometry are presented in the next two chapters. Chapter 2 is devoted to the theory of curves, while Chapter 3 deals with hypersurfaces in the Euclidean space. In the last chapter, differentiable manifolds are introduced and basic tools of analysis (differentiation and integration) on manifolds are presented. At the end of Chapter 4, these analytical techniques are applied to study the geometry of Riemannian manifolds. <br><em>Links</em>: <strong><a href=" http://etananyag.ttk.elte.hu/FiLeS/downloads/_01_Csikos_Differential_geometry.pdf" target="_blank">website</a></strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>William F. Trench</strong> <br><strong><a href=" books/debv.pdf" target="_blank">Elementary Differential Equations with Boundary Value Problems </a></strong><br><em>ID</em>: DEBV. <em>Year</em>: 2013. <em>Require</em>: CLP4.<br>(pag. 2) In order to apply mathematical methods to a physical or "real life" problem, we must formulate the problem in mathematical terms; that is, we must construct a mathematical model for the problem. Many physical problems concern relationships between changing quantities. Since rates of change are represented mathematically by derivatives, mathematical models often involve equations relating an unknown function and one or more of its derivatives. Such equations are differential equations. They are the subject of this book. <br><em>Links</em>: <strong><a href=" https://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/mono/9/" target="_blank">website</a></strong>.</p>

There is an introduction to some topics in model theory along the way, but the author has tried to keep the text tightly focused. <br><em>Links</em>: <strong><a href=" https://textbooks.opensuny.org/a-friendly-introduction-to-mathematical-logic/" target="_blank">website</a></strong>.</p>

From high in the sky, details become invisible, but we can spot patterns that were impossible to detect from ground level. What do discrete topological spaces, free groups, and fields of fractions have in common? We will discover answers to this and many similar questions, seeing patterns in mathematics that you may never have seen before. <br><em>Links</em>: <strong><a href=" https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09375" target="_blank">website</a></strong>.</p>
