    <h3>Fellipe Augusto Ugliara</h3><p><strong>Email</strong>: ugliara.fellipe@gmail.com<br><strong>Mobile</strong>: +55 (15) 99839-6143</p><h2>Resume</h2><p>Software development in several areas such as mining, airports,health, manufacturing, and finance. Experience with different systems, like critical applications, cloud computing, and embedded devices. The specialties are Programming Languages, Compilers, Interpreters, Architecture of Software, Open-source Projects, and Research Projects.</p><h2>Education</h2><p><strong>Master of Computer Science</strong> <br>(<em>2016 - 2018; Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos</em>)<br>This graduate covered topics of Computer Science with an emphasis on Programming Languages. The research topic was metaprogramming, and the courses studied were programming languages, computer theory, compilers, and algorithms.</p><p><strong>Bachelor of Computer Science</strong> <br>(<em>2006 - 2010; Universidade Federal de Lavras</em>)<br>This undergraduate covered the topics of Computer Science with an emphasis on Embedded Systems. In the two early years were studiedmathematics courses like logic, calculus, algebra and computer theory, while the computer courses were focused on algorithms and programming languages. The last two years were directed to courses like operational systems, compilers, computer architecture, and embedded software.</p><h2>Experience</h2><p><strong>Software Architect</strong> <br>(<em>September, 2014 - Present; FIT, Sorocaba</em>)<br>Defining architecture and leading teams are the main activity in this function. Payment and manufacturing systems are the areas of major projects. The teams usually involve from five to ten people, and the programming languages used are C, C++, Python, SQL, C#, Java, and Javascript.</p><p><strong>Senior Analyst Developer</strong> <br>(<em>August, 2013 - August, 2014; FIT, Sorocaba</em>) <br>During this period, applications for payment terminals (POS) were developed. Systems were also created to automate POS manufacturing steps. The main programming languages used were C, C++, Python, and Lua.</p><p><strong>Analyst Developer</strong> <br>(<em>July, 2012 - July, 2013; Mosaico, Santo Andre</em>)<br>In this function, embedded software was developed for medical equipment. The microcontrollers of PIC family were used in these devices; auxiliary software that communicated with the embedded devices were implemented in QT. The programming languages used were C, and C++.</p><p><strong>Analyst Developer</strong> <br>(<em>July, 2011 - July, 2012; Atech, Sao Paulo</em>)<br>In this work, a system of allocation aircraft landings was developed. This critical system helped flight controllers decide which order the aircraft should land on and how they would travel from the airport to a particular landing gate. In it, geo-referenced aircraft location modules and scheduling algorithms were implemented. The programming language used in the project was Java.</p><p><strong>Junior Analyst Developer</strong> <br>(<em>September, 2010 - June, 2011; Compsis, S. J. dos Campos</em>)<br>A scripting language and its interpreter were designed and implemented. The interpreter was embedded in a device that monitoring construction vehicles. It allowed to change the behavior of the device, replacing the script that was interpreted, without its firmware being rewritten. The programming languages involved were C, and C++.</p><p><strong>Trainee Developer</strong> <br>(<em>November, 2009 - July, 2010; Devex, Lavras</em>)<br>In this activity, a monitoring and tracking device was developed for mining vehicles. This device was designed with an ARM microcontroller, and a Linux distribution was compiled from scratch. The programming languages used were C, C++, Shell Script, and Python.</p><p><strong>Trainee Tester</strong> <br>(<em>July, 2009 - November, 2009; Devex, Lavras</em>)<br>Source code validations and tests of embedded systems were performed in this job. The tests were applied on devices that monitor and track mining vehicles and equipment. The programming languages involved were C, Pascal, and SQL.</p><h2>Languages</h2><p>Portuguese (<em>Native</em>)<br>English (<em>Professional Working</em>)</p>
